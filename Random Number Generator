/Using Workspaces, create a Random Number Generator!

//See if you can build a program that collects a number from a user, then prints out a random number from 1 to the 
//number the user selects. Then allow the use to try again after given the user a clue to what the number is 

//E.g the number is higher than your guess




var correctGuess = false;
var randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6 ) + 1;
var guess = prompt('I am thinking of a number between 1 and 6. What is it?');
if (parseInt(guess) === randomNumber ) {
  correctGuess = true;
} 
else if (parseInt(guess) < randomNumber)
{
  var guessMore = prompt("Try again. The number I am thinking of is more than " + guess);
}
         if (parseInt(guessMore) === randomNumber)
          {
          correctGuess = true;
          }
  else if (parseInt(guess) > randomNumber){
   var guessMore = prompt("try again. The number I am thinking of is less than " + guess); 
  }
          if (parseInt(guessMore) === randomNumber)
          {
          correctGuess = true;
          }
  
if ( correctGuess ) {
    document.write('<p>You guessed the number!</p>');
} else {
  
    document.write('<p>Sorry. The number was ' + randomNumber + '.</p>');
}
